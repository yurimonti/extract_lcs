# extract_lcs
it's a terminal's program in C that allows to extract into an output file an LCS (Longest Common Subsequence) between two binary files.

Command to run this program is: extractlcs <first_input_file_path> <second_input_file_path> <output_file_path>

To Compile and get the executable needs cmake tools:
open the terminal in the project folder and exec: cmake CMakeLists.txt
Now it's possible to run make command in the same folder: cmake
This creates an executable file named extractlcs.
Now you can exec this program : extractlcs <first_input_file_path> <second_input_file_path> <output_file_path>
